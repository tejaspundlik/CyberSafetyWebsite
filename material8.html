                            Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key
                            cryptography, is a process that uses a pair of
                            related keys -- one public key and one private key
                            -- to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it
                            from unauthorized access or use.
                        </p>

                            Asymmetric encryption uses a mathematically related
                            pair of keys for encryption and decryption: a public
                            key and a private key. If the public key is used for
                            encryption, then the related private key is used for
                            decryption. If the private key is used for
                            encryption, then the related public key is used for
                            decryption.

                            The two participants in the asymmetric encryption
                            workflow are the sender and the receiver. Each has
                            its own pair of public and private keys. First, the
                            sender obtains the receiver's public key. Next, the
                            plaintext message is encrypted by the sender using
                            the receiver's public key. This creates ciphertext.
                            The ciphertext is sent to the receiver, who decrypts
                            it with their private key, returning it to legible
                            plaintext. <br /><br />Because of the one-way nature
                            of the encryption function, one sender is unable to
                            read the messages of another sender, even though
                            each has the public key of the receiver.

                        <p>
                            Asymmetric cryptography is typically used to
                            authenticate data using digital signatures. A
                            digital signature is a mathematical technique used
                            to validate the authenticity and integrity of a
                            message, software or digital document. It is the
                            digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or
                            stamped seal.
                            <br />
                            Asymmetric cryptography can also be applied to
                            systems in which many users may need to encrypt and
                            decrypt messages, including:

                                    It's a slow process compared to symmetric
                                    cryptography. Therefore, it's not
                                    appropriate for decrypting bulk messages.

                                    If an individual loses his private key, he
                                    can't decrypt the messages he receives.

                                    Because public keys aren't authenticated, no
                                    one can ensure a public key belongs to the
                                    person specified. Consequently, users must
                                    verify that their public keys belong to
                                    them.

                                    If a malicious actor identifies a person's

                                    individual's messages.

                                <p>
                                    he most widely used asymmetric algorithm --
                                    is embedded in the SSL/TLS, which is used to
                                    provide secure communications over a
                                    computer network. RSA derives its security
                                    from the computational difficulty of
                                    factoring large integers that are the
                                    product of two large prime numbers.
                                    Multiplying two large primes is easy, but
                                    the difficulty of determining the original
                                    numbers from the product factoring forms the
                                    basis of public-key cryptography security.
                                    The time it takes to factor the product of
                                    two sufficiently large primes is beyond the
                                    capabilities of most attackers. RSA keys are
                                    typically 1024 or 2048 bits long, but
                                    experts believe 1024-bit keys will be broken
                                    soon, which is why government and industry
                                    are moving to a minimum key length of
                                    2048-bits.

                                <h3>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</h3>
                                <p>
                                    (ECC) is gaining favor with many security
                                    experts as an alternative to RSA. ECC is a
                                    public-key encryption technique based on
                                    elliptic curve theory. It can create faster,
                                    smaller and more efficient cryptographic
                                    keys through the properties of the elliptic
                                    curve equation.
                                    <br /><br />To break ECC, an attacker must
                                    compute an elliptic curve discrete
                                    logarithm, which is significantly more
                                    difficult problem than factoring. As a
                                    result, ECC key sizes can be significantly
                                    smaller than those required by RSA while
                                    still delivering equivalent security with
                                    lower computing power and battery resource
                                    usage.
