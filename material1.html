            <h2>Why is Cyber Safety Important?</h2>
            <p>
              One of the prime reasons for implementing Cyber Safety is the
              protection of confidential data. Cyber Safety can protect these
              data to a great extent. These data protection go a long way,
              especially in cases of government-related data. Breach of such
              data of national importance can cause serious disturbance to the
              nation.<br /><br />
              Additionally, a breach of personal data would result in personal
              losses such as reputation damage, etc. There are high chances of
              an extortion threat. By giving in to the threat, there are chances
              of financial damages. <br />
              <br />
              Data privacy is important in this digital world. For example,
              breach of personally identifiable information (PII), intellectual
              property, and protected health information (PHI) would make people
              lose faith in the service and the possibility of recovering lost
              customers or building faith again is a herculean task. This is
              usually applicable in the sectors of hospitals and other
              healthcare institutions, financial service programs, and power
              plants. <br /><br />
              However, the most fearsome aspect of the data breach through any
              cyberattack is the mishandling of data. Through the following
              segment, you will understand the various types of cyber attacks.
              Based on the understanding of cyber-attacks and why cyber safety
              is important, you can implement cyber safety measures accordingly.

            <h2>Types of Cyber Attacks</h2>

            <ul>
              <li><h3>Malware</h3></li>
              <p>
                Malware, or malicious software, is any program or file that is
                intentionally harmful to a computer, network or server. Types of
                malware include computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses,
                ransomware and spyware. These malicious programs steal, encrypt
                and delete sensitive data alter or hijack core computing
                functions and monitor end users' computer activity. Learn more
                about malware <a href="#">here</a>.
              </p>
              <li><h3>Identity Theft</h3></li>
              <p>
                Identity theft occurs when criminals steal a victim's personal
                information to commit criminal acts. Using this stolen
                information, a criminal takes over the victim's identity and
                conducts a range of fraudulent activities in their name.
              </p>
              <li><h3>Social Engineering Attack</h3></li>
              <p>
                Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of
                malicious activities accomplished through human interactions. It
                uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making
                security mistakes or giving away sensitive information. Social
                engineering attacks happen in one or more steps. <br /><br />A
                perpetrator first investigates the intended victim to gather
                necessary background information, such as potential points of
                entry and weak security protocols, needed to proceed with the
                attack. Then, the attacker moves to gain the victim’s trust and
                provide stimuli for subsequent actions that break security
                practices, such as revealing sensitive information or granting
                access to critical resources. <br />
                <br />
                Types of social engineering attacks include baiting, phishing,
                vishing, etc. Learn more about social engineering attacks

              <li><h3>SQL Injection Attacks</h3></li>
              <p>
                Structured Query Language (SQL) injection is a common method of
                taking advantage of websites that depend on databases to serve
                their users. Clients are computers that get information from
                servers, and an SQL attack uses an SQL query sent from the
                client to a database on the server. The command is inserted, or
                “injected”, into a data plane in place of something else that
                normally goes there, such as a password or login. The server
                that holds the database then runs the command and the system is
                penetrated.

            <h2>Cyber Safety Tips</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Create a strong password for all platforms. Try to create
                  unique passwords. Most importantly, the passwords are not
                  related at all. In this way, hackers will not succeed in their
                  password guessing methodology.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Take regular, full back ups with rotation offsite. Take cloud
                  back ups with versioning turned on and make sure external hard
                  drives are only plugged in when backing up.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Use an anti-virus software. The free stuff is great, just make
                  sure its enabled and updated.

                  Always turn on two-factor authentication on your social media
                  platforms. In that way, you will be alerted whenever there is
                  an attempt to access your account.

            <p>
              It is always important to keep your data private and safe.
              Cyber-attacks have evolved throughout the years to enter your
              system/ network undetected. Thus, it is always important to be
              upgraded and updated on your Cyber Safety system to protect your
              data.
