                    <p>
                        Malware is software that is specifically designed to
                        disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a
                        computer system.

                        While there are many different variations of
                        malware, you are most likely to encounter the
                        following malware types:

                    <p>
                        Ransomware is software that uses encryption to
                        disable a target's access to its data until a ransom
                        is paid. The victim organization is rendered
                        partially or totally unable to operate until it
                        pays, but there is no guarantee that payment will
                        result in the necessary decryption key or that the
                        decryption key provided will function properly.

                        Spyware collects information about usersâ€™ activities

                        The use of spyware is not limited to the desktop
                        browser: it can also operate in a critical app or on

                                Stuxnet was probably developed by the US and
                                Israeli intelligence forces with the intent
                                of setting back Iran's nuclear program. It
                                was introduced into Iran's environment
