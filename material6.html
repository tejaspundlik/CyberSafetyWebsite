                        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
                        <p>
                            Plagiarism is a type of cyber-attack where someone
                            takes your work and posts it under their name. This
                            can be done through various means, such as copying
                            and pasting text from a website or document,
                            submitting someone else's work as one's own, or
                            paraphrasing someone else's work without giving them
                            credit. Plagiarism can harm individuals and
                            businesses in several ways. For example, it can
                            damage the reputation of the original author,
                            decrease the value of their work, and potentially
                            result in legal action. In academic and professional
                            settings, plagiarism can result in academic or
                            professional misconduct charges, which can lead to
                            disciplinary action or even expulsion. In addition,
                            plagiarism can also have serious consequences in the
                            digital world. Search engines like Google use
                            algorithms to detect duplicate content and penalize
                            websites that use it. This can result in a decrease
                            in website traffic and damage to a website's search
                            engine ranking. Therefore, it is important for
                            individuals and businesses to take measures to
                            prevent plagiarism and ensure that all content is
                            original and properly attributed. This includes
                            using plagiarism checker tools, providing proper
                            citations and references, and creating unique
                            content.

                            Cyber threats can affect your system/ network in the

                            implementing Cyber Safety measures, you can prevent
                            the effects of cyber-attacks to a great extent.

                                Whenever there is any Cyber breach, there will
                                be a need to upgrade your Cyber Safety system.
                                This will incur additional expenses. The expense
                                is inclusive of new/up-gradation of Cyber
                                Security Technology, Cyber Safety insurance,
                                public relations support, and more of similar
                                nature. Notifying the affected parties of a
                                particular breach could even result in loss of
                                customers.

                                Cyber Safety breach results in the disruption of
                                operation. When there is any cyber-attack, the
                                operation of business comes to a halt for
                                various reasons. If the business operation is
                                continued, the hacker would continue to get
                                access to the confidential information.

                                On the other hand, when certain types of Cyber
                                Safety breaches render the computer/ network
                                inoperable, it would sometimes take weeks to
                                even months to recover the computer/ network.
                                Furthermore, sometimes the access to backup data
                                would also be troublesome.

                                Along with data breaches, comes the issue of
                                reputational damage. When an organization faces
                                a Cyber Safety breach of data leakage, customers
                                often land up with a dozen questions on privacy
                                and integrity. Needless to say, if your
                                organization is known across borders, quite a
                                few conspiracy theories would arise inevitably.
                                This will affect the morale of your
                                organizations workers as well.
