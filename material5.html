                        <p>
                            Social engineering is the term used for a broad
                            range of malicious activities accomplished through
                            human interactions. It uses psychological
                            manipulation to trick users into making security
                            mistakes or giving away sensitive information.

                        <h2>Types of Social Engineering</h2>

                            <p>
                                As one of the most popular social engineering
                                attack types, phishing scams are email and text
                                message campaigns aimed at creating a sense of
                                urgency, curiosity or fear in victims. It then
                                prods them into revealing sensitive information,
                                clicking on links to malicious websites, or
                                opening attachments that contain malware.

                            <p>
                                As its name implies, baiting attacks use a false
                                promise to pique a victim's greed or curiosity.
                                They lure users into a trap that steals their
                                personal information or inflicts their systems
                                with malware.
                            </p>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Spear Phishing</h3>
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                This is a more targeted version of the phishing
                                scam whereby an attacker chooses specific
                                individuals or enterprises. They then tailor
                                their messages based on characteristics, job
                                positions, and contacts belonging to their
                                victims to make their attack less conspicuous.
                                Spear phishing requires much more effort on
                                behalf of the perpetrator and may take weeks and
                                months to pull off. They're much harder to
                                detect and have better success rates if done
                                skillfully.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The attacker usually starts by establishing
                                trust with their victim by impersonating
                                co-workers, police, bank and tax officials, or
                                other persons who have right-to-know authority.
                                The pretexter asks questions that are ostensibly
                                required to confirm the victim's identity,
                                through which they gather important personal
                                data.

                            (DDoS) Attack" and it is a cybercrime in which the
                            attacker floods a server with internet traffic to
                            prevent users from accessing connected online
                            services and sites.

                        <h2>DDoS vs. DoS</h2>
                        <p>
                            A distributed denial-of-service attack is a
                            subcategory of the more general denial-of-service
                            (DoS) attack. In a DoS attack, the attacker uses a
                            single internet connection to barrage a target with
                            fake requests or to try and exploit a cybersecurity
                            vulnerability. DDoS is larger in scale. It utilizes
                            thousands (even millions) of connected devices to
                            fulfill its goal. The sheer volume of the devices
                            used makes DDoS much harder to fight.

                            A man in the middle (MITM) attack is a general term
                            for when a perpetrator positions himself in a
                            conversation between a user and an
                            application—either to eavesdrop or to impersonate
                            one of the parties, making it appear as if a normal
                            exchange of information is underway.

                        <p>
                            A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses
                            trial and error to crack passwords, login
                            credentials, and encryption keys. It is a simple yet
                            reliable tactic for gaining unauthorized access to
                            individual accounts and organization's systems and
                            networks. The hacker tries multiple usernames and
                            passwords, often using a computer to test a wide
                            range of combinations, until they find the correct

                            Domain Name Server (DNS) spoofing (a.k.a. DNS cache
                            poisoning) is an attack in which altered DNS records
                            are used to redirect online traffic to a fraudulent
                            website that resembles its intended destination.
