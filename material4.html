            <p>
              Malware is software that is specifically designed to disrupt,
              damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.
              <br />
              While there are many different variations of malware, you are most
              likely to encounter the following malware types:

            <h2>Ransomware</h2>
            <p>
              Ransomware is software that uses encryption to disable a target's
              access to its data until a ransom is paid. The victim organization
              is rendered partially or totally unable to operate until it pays,
              but there is no guarantee that payment will result in the
              necessary decryption key or that the decryption key provided will
              function properly.

                  The city of Baltimore was hit by a type of ransomware named
                  RobbinHood, which halted all city activities, including tax
                  collection, property transfers, and government email for
                  weeks. This attack has cost the city more than $18 million so
                  far, and costs continue to accrue. The same type of malware
                  was used against the city of Atlanta in 2018, resulting in
                  costs of $17 million.

            <p>
              Spyware collects information about usersâ€™ activities without their
              knowledge or consent. This can include passwords, pins, payment
              information and unstructured messages.
              <br />
              The use of spyware is not limited to the desktop browser: it can
              also operate in a critical app or on a mobile phone.

                  DarkHotel, which targeted business and government leaders
                  using hotel WIFI, used several types of malware in order to
                  gain access to the systems belonging to specific powerful
                  people. Once that access was gained, the attackers installed
                  keyloggers to capture their targets passwords and other

            <p>
              Adware tracks a user's surfing activity to determine which ads to
              serve them. Although adware is similar to spyware, it does not
              install any software on a user's computer, nor does it capture
              keystrokes.

                  Adware called Fireball infected 250 million computers and
                  devices in 2017, hijacking browsers to change default search
                  engines and track web activity. However, the malware had the
                  potential to become more than a mere nuisance. Three-quarters
                  of it was able to run code remotely and download malicious
                  files.

              A Trojan disguises itself as desirable code or software. Once
              downloaded by unsuspecting users, the Trojan can take control of
              victim's systems for malicious purposes. Trojans may hide in

                  Emotet is a sophisticated banking trojan that has been around
                  since 2014. It is hard to fight Emotet because it evades
                  signature-based detection, is persistent, and includes
                  spreader modules that help it propagate. The trojan is so
                  widespread that it is the subject of a US Department of
                  Homeland Security alert, which notes that Emotet has cost
                  state, local, tribal and territorial governments up to $1

              Worms target vulnerabilities in operating systems to install

              through backdoors built into software, through unintentional
              software vulnerabilities, or through flash drives. Once in place,
              worms can be used by malicious actors to launch DDoS
              <a href="#">( What is a DDoS attack ? )</a> attacks, steal
              sensitive data, or conduct ransomware attacks.

                  Stuxnet was probably developed by the US and Israeli
                  intelligence forces with the intent of setting back Iran's
                  nuclear program. It was introduced into Iran's environment
                  through a flash drive. Because the environment was air-gapped,
                  its creators never thought Stuxnet would escape its target's
                  network â€” but it did. Once in the wild, Stuxnet spread
                  aggressively but did little damage, since its only function
                  was to interfere with industrial controllers that managed the
                  uranium enrichment process.

              A virus is a piece of code that inserts itself into an application
              and executes when the app is run. Once inside a network, a virus
              may be used to steal sensitive data, launch DDoS attacks or
              conduct ransomware attacks.

                  A virus cannot execute or reproduce unless the app it has
